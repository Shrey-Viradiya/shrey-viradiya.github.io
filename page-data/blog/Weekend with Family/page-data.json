Just had a chill weekend with family in Rajkot, a city nearly 200 km far. I went to Rajkot after 8 years. It was a surprise for everyone. Only my brother and sister-in-law knew.</p>\n<p>Spending time together with family was fun. We had a family function so everyone was tired after 2 days. Two days passed like a couple of hours. Not making this blog a boring daily dairy story. But just wanted to write down, I feel staying away from the family can make us feel homesick. Yet, I did not go to my home town 😅😜. Home is where family is. So people, if you are reading it, spend time with your family. Give them a surprise.</p>\n<p>“My sister slapped me because she wasn’t expecting me to wake her up from her nap, totally worth it 💛”</p>\n<h2>Well, here is one photo I took from this small trip. 👇</h2>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1200px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ccadb9841d780ac76ead736b7203ebd8/e5166/CarRajkot.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 133.3984375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Morning drive in Rajkot\"\n        title=\"Morning drive in Rajkot\"\n        src=\"/static/ccadb9841d780ac76ead736b7203ebd8/e5166/CarRajkot.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ccadb9841d780ac76ead736b7203ebd8/36dd4/CarRajkot.jpg 512w,\n/static/ccadb9841d780ac76ead736b7203ebd8/72e01/CarRajkot.jpg 1024w,\n/static/ccadb9841d780ac76ead736b7203ebd8/e5166/CarRajkot.jpg 1200w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Tomorrow, I have a flight back to Bengaluru.
