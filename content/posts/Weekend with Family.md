description: A short surprise trip to Rajkot
---

In Ahmedabad right now. Just had a chill weekend with family in Rajkot, a city nearly 200 km far. I went to Rajkot after 8 years. It was a surprise for everyone. Only my brother and sister-in-law knew.

Spending time together with family was fun. We had a family function so everyone was tired after 2 days. Two days passed like a couple of hours. Not making this blog a boring daily dairy story. But just wanted to write down, I feel staying away from the family can make us feel homesick. Yet, I did not go to my home town ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜œ. Home is where family is. So people, if you are reading it, spend time with your family. Give them a surprise.

## Well, here is one photo I took from this small trip. ðŸ‘‡

Tomorrow, I have a flight back to Bengaluru. Btw, I must tell you that Rajkot looks so beautiful and well-developed. It's much smaller than Bangalore but more beautiful and developed.
